# Portfolio 2: Movement

### This sketch uses random movement to create unique pieces of experimental artwork. As time goes on, the canvas becomes fuller, getting filled with lines (not straight lines) drawn with circles of varying blue. The values of rgb that are random/fixed can be switched around to have different/more varied colour themes, which creates interesting results.
> The sketch makes heavy use of randomised variables to create something unique every time. 
>
> Random variables between 1 and -1 add to/take away from the x and y velocities, creating a jittery, random movement, which is used to draw a line with circles.
> Maximum velocities for the x and y were added, as this made the resulting artwork more visually appealing, and generally causes less lines to stay in one direction and dart across the screen.
>
> When the line reaches a boarder of the canvas, the coordinates of the brush are set back to the centre of it, and variables for the rgb colour of the circles/lines being drawn get changed randomly. So the next line drwn is of a different colour, and will draw randomly again until it reaches another end to the canvas.
>
> Random variables for the rgb changes the colour. I decided on keeping it as shades of blue as it was what looked the nicest to me, and the resulting canvas made me think of the ocean and its calming varying blue colours.
