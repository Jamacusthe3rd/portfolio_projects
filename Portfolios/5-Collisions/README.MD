# Portfolio 5: Collisions

### This sketch is a simple example of a painting application, allowing the user to draw circles on the screen and to change a few things about their brush (size, colour).
>This is an interactive sketch, using collision to detect if the mouse is clicked on certain circles on the screen (the palette menu's colours on the left)
>
>The sketch then allows the user to paint on the canvas by holding down the mouse click and dragging, using the colour they selected. 
>
>The user can also use the scroll wheel to change the size of the brush they are painting with.
>
>The bottom left corner (in the palette menu) shows to the user the colour currently selected, along with the size of their brush.
