# Portfolio 1: Drawing

### This sketch is a recreation of "Target" - Jasper Johns (1958). 

>I used circles and a background, assigned differing rgb colours, to create the target on the canvas.
>
>I then painted some images to act as a textured look, like the original artwork had. These images were then loaded with a lower alpha value,, so the target is still shown.
>
>It was somewhat effective at achieving a textured result.
>
>texture 1, the one in use for the sketch, gave a result which made it look like the target shape was printed onto a piece of fabric, like a flag.
>
>texture 2 gives a look like the target was painted on metal a long time ago, and rust has begun to set in.
>
>texture 3 i feel doesn't give an effective or aesthetic look.
>
>However, these images/textures i made with the windows 10 paint app, which means they do not look as good as they could, but also means the blank space is actually white, and as the alpha was reduced for the image of the texture being added, the whiteness caused the colours of the artwork to appear faded/lighter than intended.
>
>The best solution to this would be to create textures with a better painting app, one which can also use empty space in an easy and efficient way.
